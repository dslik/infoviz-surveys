## Waterfall visualizations overview

Waterfall visualizations represent three dimensions of information as an image on a 2D plane, where one of the dimensions is time.

Axis are typically:

* x axis: time or frequency
* y axis: frequency or time
* z axis: signal intensity as grayscale or a colour spectrum

The x and y axis can be panned to move backwards and forward in time and in frequency space. Often the edge of the display is set to the current time, with the data scrolling to the side or down over time, resulting in the characteristic resemblance to a waterfall.

Zooming in or out allows a larger or smaller region of time and frequency to be displayed. Alternatively, the visible area

Different communities have different conventions regarding which axis should be used for which variable. For example, radio astronomy tends to put time on the x axis, while radio engineering tends to put frequency on the x axis, so that a traditional spectrum analyzer display can be shown above or below the waterfall display.

Adjusting the range of values displayed in the z axis, or changing the mapping between input values and displayed colours allow for certain features to be emphasized.

## Representative sample

The below waterfall display is from the [SatNOGS - Satellite Network Open Ground Station](https://satnogs.org) project. It displays frequency on the x axis, time on the y axis, and signal intensity in dB as a colour gradient.

Axis labels for all three dimensions are provided, two aligned with the waterfall display, with intensity displayed on the side.
